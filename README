This archive contains the distribution Dancer-Plugin-MongoDB,
version 0.35:

  Dancer plugin for MongoDB - Using Mango

  Yes, this is a Mojolicious piece inside of Dancer. But when good
  work is done, might as well use it. :-)

  Also note that very valid, and very cool code is heavily borrowed
  from Dancer::Plugin::Database. Maybe at some point in the future
  they can be combined? :-)
